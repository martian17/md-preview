//! The document-update contract — the "plane of separation".
//!
//! Everything that mutates or syncs a document goes through [`DocSession`]. A
//! CRDT (currently `yrs`, see [`crate::session`]) implements it; the file
//! watcher ([`crate::file_peer`]), and later the WebSocket transport and
//! persistence, are adapters that sit *behind* this trait. Because the `.md`
//! text file remains the canonical source of truth, a `DocSession`'s state can
//! always be reconstructed from text — there is no durable CRDT-format lock-in,
//! which is what keeps the underlying library swappable.
//!
//! All positions are expressed in **UTF-16 code units**. That is the unit JS /
//! browser peers use, so fixing it here (rather than Rust-native UTF-8 bytes)
//! avoids a translation layer at the browser boundary and prevents the classic
//! "edit landed at the wrong offset on non-ASCII text" corruption.

/// A minimal text edit: remove `del` UTF-16 code units at `pos`, then insert
/// `ins`. This is the shared currency between the diff engine
/// ([`crate::diff`]) and a [`DocSession`].
///
/// Edits are deliberately *minimal* (char-level, never line-level): coarse
/// "delete-all + reinsert" edits churn CRDT tombstones and clobber concurrent
/// edits from other peers instead of merging with them.
///
/// Within a batch passed to [`DocSession::apply`], all `pos`/`del` are in the
/// coordinate space of the document *before* the batch, and edits are
/// non-overlapping. See [`DocSession::apply`] for the full batch contract.
