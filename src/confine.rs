//! `confine` — the SOLE confinement funnel for all filesystem access.
//!
//! This is the SOLE confinement funnel; every read/save/asset path MUST route
//! through it (audit 04 single-funnel; audit 02 TOCTOU fix). Before this module
//! the funnel was split across `server.rs` (`confine_abs`, `confine_link`) and
//! `asset_origin.rs` (`Confiner::confine`), each re-resolving the same path and
//! each *adding* TOCTOU surface (audit/02-security.md HIGH-2, HIGH-3, MED-4).
//! Track-3 unifies all of it here.
//!
//! ## The invariants this module enforces *by construction*
//!
//! 1. **One funnel, no softer path.** Every caller-supplied path is resolved
//!    here and nowhere else. [`confine_path`] is the lexical/canonical gate;
//!    [`confine_read`], [`confine_save`] and [`confine_link`] build on it.
//!
//! 2. **TOCTOU-free reads (audit HIGH-2 / HIGH-3).** [`confine_read`] does NOT
//!    "confine, then stat, then read" across three separate path syscalls.
//!    Instead it confines the path, then **`open()`s the file exactly once with
//!    `O_NOFOLLOW`**, and **`fstat`s THAT SAME descriptor** for the size cap and
//!    permission mode. The returned [`ConfinedFile`] hands the caller the held
//!    `File` plus the `Metadata` read from that fd — so the route layer (W3)
//!    reads from the held fd and applies the permission floor to the *fstat'd*
//!    metadata. There is no second `stat`, no re-`open`, and the final component
//!    can never be a followed symlink.
//!
//! 3. **Symlink-safe saves (audit HIGH-2, follow-up F1).** [`confine_save`]
//!    never writes through a possibly-symlinked path with `fs::write`, and never
//!    re-resolves the parent by path after confining it. It holds the confined
//!    parent as a **dirfd** opened with `O_DIRECTORY | O_NOFOLLOW`, then creates
//!    the temp via `openat(dirfd, …, O_CREAT|O_EXCL|O_WRONLY|O_NOFOLLOW)` and
//!    commits via `renameat(dirfd, temp, dirfd, target)`. Every step is relative
//!    to the held dirfd, so neither the final component NOR an intermediate
//!    parent component swapped to a symlink *after* the dirfd is held can
//!    redirect the write outside the confined directory.
//!
//! 4. **Denylist always applies (audit MED-4).** Sensitive / denylisted paths
//!    are rejected even on the empty-registry fallback. `roots::is_sensitive`
//!    is consulted on *every* path regardless of whether [`Roots::union`] is
//!    empty.
//!
//! ## What this module does NOT do
//! It does **not** apply the authentication permission floor. [`confine_read`]
//! returns the fstat'd [`std::fs::Metadata`] so the route layer (W3) can call
//! `auth::floor_allows(auth::mode_of(&meta), authenticated)` on the *same* fd's
//! metadata. Keeping the floor out of the funnel keeps the funnel free of the
//! auth-state dependency while still giving the route the held-fd metadata it
//! needs to honour "never serve what the caller couldn't already read".
//!
//! No `unwrap` / `expect` / `panic` in production code paths.
